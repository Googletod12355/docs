## Changing the version of your Minecraft Server

1. Stop your server and create a **backup**
2. Navigate to the **Startup** tab, and change the **Version** field to the version you wish to use
3. In the **Settings** tab, click **Reinstall** to start the update process
4. Start the server and run the **/version** command to check if the version has been changed

</Warning>
  Downgrading server versions is far more difficult as you cannot port whole worlds back versions without a backup. It requires you to manually move builds with schematics, and proper checking for new blocks.
</Warning>

## What Java version do I need for each version in Minecraft?

You may encounter a Java error in the console when updating a new version, this could mean that you have an incompatible Java version. To fix this, you can update your **Java version** or change the Java Version variable in the **Settings** tab to the appropriate version:
- **Java 8:** Minecraft 1.14 - 1.16.5
- **Java 16:** Minecraft 1.17 - 1.17.1
- **Java 17:** Minecraft 1.18 - Newest (Recommended - Stable)
- **Java 18 - 21:** Newest
