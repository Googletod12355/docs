Personalizing your server can attract players. One of the first things potential players see is your server icon in their multiplayer server list. Here’s how to set a custom server icon for your Minecraft server.

## Server Icon Specifications
Before creating your icon, know these requirements:

- **Size:** The icon must be 64x64 pixels. (You can use [This Tool](https://imageresizer.com) to resize the image)
- **Format:** The image should be saved as **.PNG**.
- **Name:** The file must be named and saved as **server-icon.png**.


## Upload and Set Icon to Your Server
Have the icon ready and size/name is all good? Let’s upload the icon and set it for your server:

1. Save your icon as **server-icon.png** and a size of 64x64px.
2. Upload the icon to the main directory of your server (**Files -> Upload**)
3. Restart your server

That’s it! Your server icon should now be visible in the server list.
