## Find the IP address of your Minecraft Server

Before you can join and connect to your **Minecraft server**, you’ll need to find the **IP** (a combination of numbers, e.g 104.167.215.1) or a **subdomain** (letters, e.g test.eclipseno.de).

1. Head to the Console of your server
2. Look for the **Address** field. This is the IP address or subdomain you will use to connect to your server.
3. Click on the box to copy the IP address or subdomain.

## Joining a Minecraft Server on Java Edition

1. Launch Minecraft
2. Select **Multiplayer** from the main menu
3. Click **Add Server** to add the server to your server list
4. Enter a name and your server’s IP:port in the **Server Name** and **Server Address** field
5. Click on the server from the server list to join your server!

Alternatively, you can select **Direct Connection** and enter the subdomain or IP:port in the **Server Address** field. This lets you directly connect without having to add a server to the server list first.


## Joining a Minecraft Server on Bedrock Edition

1. Launch Minecraft and select **Play** from the menu
2. Select the **Servers** tab from the top of the screen
3. Scroll past the featured servers and click **Add Server**
4. Fill in the **Server Name** and **Server Address** and **Port** fields and Save
4. Select your server from the list and click **Join Server** to join the server!

That’s it! You should now be connected to your Minecraft server. If you have any issues or need help, feel free to contact our support team!

  Please wait a few seconds upon connecting to allow your server to accept the connection.
