Setting up the GSLT token is very important if you want your server to be publicly listed on the server list. It’s thankfully very easy and simple to add and this guide will show you how to do it on your Physgun server!

To do this you first want to navigate to [Valve’s GSLT Page](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers) and login to your Steam account. Please note you will need to own a copy of Garry’s Mod.


At the bottom of the page you will find the form.
For Garry’s Mod you will want to enter the App ID of '4000'. For the memo you can keep it blank or label it, your choice!
Now you should have a key tied to your Steam account!

The “Login Token” will be the key you put into the Startup vairable called 'Steam Account Token' in the EclipseNode Panel

Simply restart your Garry's Mod server and it should become publicly available on the server list
