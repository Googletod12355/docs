Firstly navigate to your `server.cfg`
To change the name of your server you'll need to navigate to `/garrysmod/cfg/server.cfg`
Afterwords you will see an option named 'hostname "Server hosted by EclipseNode"' - this is the default hostname applied to all EclipseNode servers!

To set your desired server name simply type inside the quotes! Example below:

`hostname "My Very Epic Server | Gangs | Weed | M9k"`
