Setting your region flag is important for the Garry’s Mod server list, and it’s very easy to do!

1. Navigate to the [EclipseNode Panel](https://panel.eclipse-node.com)
2. open the 'server.cfg' file
You can find this file located in '/garrysmod/cfg/server.cfg'

3. Find the 'sv_location' option
This option will be in your server.cfg if for some reason it’s not in there you can always make it yourself!

Afterwords you will want to put the proper ISO code for the country flag you want on your server, we’ve listed some below!

United States: 'sv_location us'
United Kingdom: 'sv_location gb'
Russian: 'sv_location ru'
France: 'sv_location fr'
Canada: 'sv_location ca'
Mexico: 'sv_location mx'
