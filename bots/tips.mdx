## 1. **Secure Your Bot Token**
- **Never share your bot token** publicly. If someone gets your token, they can control your bot.
- If you suspect the token is compromised, **regenerate it** immediately from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

### Best Practices:
- Store your token in **environment variables** or a `.env` file, not directly in code.
- Use **config management tools** like `dotenv` in Node.js or `python-decouple` in Python to load sensitive data.

## 2. **Host Your Bot Code in a GitHub Repository**
Storing and managing your bot's code in a **private GitHub repository** has many advantages:

### Benefits:
- **Version control:** Track changes and revert to previous versions if something breaks.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can contribute and review the code securely.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Your code is safe even if your local environment is lost or corrupted.
- **Deployment Automation:** GitHub Actions can automate deployments to EclipseNode, reducing errors and saving time.

**Pro Tip:** Keep your `.env` file (or other sensitive configuration files) out of your repository by adding them to the `.gitignore` file.


## 3. **Use Proper Permissions**
- Grant your bot **only the permissions it needs** using Discord’s role and permission management.
- Avoid giving `Administrator` permissions unless absolutely necessary.


## 4. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
- Regularly update libraries and frameworks to patch vulnerabilities. Use:
  - `npm audit` for Node.js bots
  - `pip list --outdated` for Python bots

- Consider using **Dependabot** in GitHub to receive alerts for outdated dependencies.


## 5. **Monitor Logs and Errors**
- Use logging to track suspicious behavior and detect issues early.
- EclipseNode’s Pterodactyl panel allows you to view **real-time logs** to catch potential errors or unauthorized actions.


## 6. **Rate Limiting and Anti-Spam Measures**
- Implement **cooldowns** on commands to prevent spam.
- Use Discord’s **rate limits** wisely to avoid your bot getting blocked by the API.


## 7. **Validate User Input**
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent command injection attacks.
- Avoid directly executing user inputs in your bot logic.


## 8. **Use OAuth2 for Authorization**
- Use **OAuth2 scopes** carefully when allowing other users or servers to add your bot.
- Use `guilds` and `applications.commands` scopes to limit access appropriately.

By following these practices, you’ll ensure your bot operates securely and smoothly, reducing the risk of breaches or outages. GitHub hosting helps you maintain structured, secure, and collaborative code development.
