## How to Find Your Server ID

1. Login to the panel.

2. Click on the server you want to find the ID for.

3. The server ID will be displayed in the URL for your server. It will be the last part of the URL, after the `/server/` part.

## Examples

For example, if the URL is `https://panel.eclipseno.de/server/ed562b5f`, the server ID is `ed562b5f`. Below you can see an example of where the server ID is located in the URL.
